# Roadmap

Before migrating to GitHub, the core development team used [a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/eQUeNKrq/superpowers) to keep track of planned features, but we are slowly moving away from it.

## Superpowers v2.0 or later

 * [Allow enabling/disabling plugins on a per-project basis](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers/issues/73) and only export enabled plugins for shorter load times
 * Superpowers Game:
   * [Allow choosing which assets to load on startup and loading the rest dynamically](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game/issues/33) for shorter load times
   * [Typed asset tree](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game/issues/35) to increase confidence when reorganizing assets

## Superpowers v1.0

This release will focus on making it easy to release and upgrade the major parts of Superpowers independently.

 * [Split the launcher from the server and redesign it](https://trello.com/c/IVEnTXCe/701-redesign-launcher)
 * Release the server and each system (aka. project type) separately with their own version numbers
 * Support updating the server and each system from the launcher
 * Superpowers Game:
   * [Support drag'n'dropping assets from the asset tree into a scene](https://github.com/superpowers/superpowers-game/issues/30)
