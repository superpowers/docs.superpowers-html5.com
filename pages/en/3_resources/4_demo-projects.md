# Demo projects

Instructions for setting up a project can be found on each project's page.
Generally, it involves clicking on `Download ZIP` page
and unzipping it into [your `projects` folder](/en/getting-started/setting-up-superpowers),
then restarting your server.

## Open Source games and demos

You can find all kinds of games and demo projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/superpowers-extra).
They will help you learn various aspects of the software.

You can play them all in the [Open Source Games made with Superpowers](http://itch.io/c/38089/open-source-games-made-with-superpowers) collection on itch.io.
