# Helping others out

The Superpowers community strives to be a friendly, inclusive, welcoming place.  
Different people with very different goals or concerns will end up chatting together.

Here are simple ideas that might help you contribute to that spirit:

## Be nice, assume good faith, don't reply to everything

Sometimes, it gets old repeating the same things over and over again and some of us might become frustrated.
It's easy to forget there are real people on the other side of the Internet.

**If you find that you can't be nice in your reply, then refrain from posting at all.** You don't have to reply to every single post or every single person. It's okay to let a post go by. Someone else who's in a better disposition will reply.

It's better for a post to go unanswered for a little while, than to inject aggressivity in a discussion.
Aggressivity engenders more aggressivity and soon it'll be driving people away.

## Dealing with non-constructive behavior and aggression

If you find someone is not contributing positively, consider pointing it out to them in a friendly way, maybe linking them to this page.

If someone is being outright aggressive or insulting and you don't see them adopting a more positive attitude, it might be best to remove yourself from the discussion and wait for a moderator to intervene.

As the Superpowers development team, we try to read and answer in the community's various communication channels whenever possible. You can [get in touch with us privately](mailto:team@sparklinlabs.com) if needed.
