# API Documentation

Since Superpowers is made out of many plugins and you can customize them and install your own, we don't provide an online <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> documentation.

Instead, use the **TypeScript API browser** tool in your Superpowers project to discover all the numerous functions and classes made available in your scripts by the plugins installed on your server.
